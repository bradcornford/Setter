### For Laravel 4.x, check [version 1.5.5](https://github.com/bradcornford/Setter/tree/v1.5.5)

Think of Setter as an easy way to integrate Settings with Laravel, providing a variety of helpers to speed up the utilisation of application wide settings. These include:

- `Setting::set`
- `Setting::get`
- `Setting::forget`
- `Setting::has`
- `Setting::all`
- `Setting::clear`
- `Setting::expires`

## Installation

Begin by installing this package through Composer. Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require `cornford/setter`.

	"require": {
		"cornford/setter": "2.*"
	}

Next, update Composer from the Terminal:

	composer update

We now have to publish the packages assets with the following command:

	php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cornford\\Setter\\SettingServiceProvider"

We now have to migrate the package database table with the following command:

	php artisan migrate

Once this operation completes, the next step is to add the service provider. Open `app/config/app.php`, and add a new item to the providers array.

	'Cornford\Setter\SettingServiceProvider',

The final step is to introduce the facade. Open `app/config/app.php`, and add a new item to the aliases array.

	'Setting'         => 'Cornford\Setter\Facades\Setting',

That's it! You're all set to go.

## Usage

It's really as simple as using the Setter class in any Controller / Model / File you see fit with:

`Setting::`

This will give you access to

- [Set](#set)
- [Get](#get)
- [Forget](#forget)
- [Has](#has)
- [All](#all)
- [Clear](#clear)
- [Expires](#expires)

### Set

The `set` method sets a setting via both a key and a value parameter in the database.

	Setting::set('app.url', 'http://localhost');

### Get

The `get` method gets a setting via a key parameter from the database, and a default value can be optionally passed if the setting doesn't exist.
If no default parameter is supplied, and an application configration variable is present, this will be returned.

	Setting::get('app.url', 'http://localhost');
	Setting::get('app.url');

### Forget

The `forget` method removes a setting via a key paramter from the database.

	Setting::forget('app.setting');

### Has

The `has` method returns a true / false based on if a setting is present in the database via a key paramter.
This doesn't fall back to checking application configuration variables.

	Setting::has('app.setting');

### All

The `all` method returns an array of key value pairs of settings from the database.
This doesn't fall back to return application configuration variables.

	Setting::all();

### Clear

The `clear` removes all settings from the database.
This doesn't fall back to removing application configuration variables.

	Setting::clear();

### Expires

The `expires` sets the cache expiry setting.
Can be false to not cache, true / 0 to cache indefinitely, an integer for minutes, or a datetime of when to expire.

	Setting::expires(false);
